Our goal at Mariner Brewing Co. is to bring a new energy to Nanaimo's social scene. Our goal is to provide a physical space for young professionals and college students to unplug and reconnect.

We believe great beer leads to great conversation. Through hands-on workshops, tasting flights, and an open-style brewing area, we aim to make the brewing process easy to understand and fun to explore. We're creating a place where strangers can become friends and every pint contributes to the development of a more vibrant, connected community, we're not just serving drinks.
